# 🚀 Welcome to **ARES 2.0** 🚀

</div>

## 🌐 Overview

🔍 **ARES 2.0** (Adversarial Robustness Evaluation for Safety) is a Python library dedicated to adversarial machine learning research. It aims at benchmarking the adversarial robustness of image classification and object detection models, and introduces mechanisms to defend against adversarial attacks through robust training.


## 🌟 Features

-  Developed on **Pytorch**.
- Supports [various attacks](/ares/attack/__init__.py) on classification models.
- Employs adversarial attacks on object detection models.
- Provides robust training for enhanced robustness and various trained **checkpoints**.
- Enables distributed training and testing.


## 💾 Installation

1. **Optional**: Initialize a dedicated environment for ARES 2.0.
   
   ```
   conda create -n ares python==3.10.9
   conda activate ares
   ```
2. Clone and set up ARES 2.0 via the following commands:
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thu-ml/ares2.0
   cd ares2.0
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   mim install mmengine==0.8.4
   mim install mmcv==2.0.0 
   mim install mmdet==3.1.0
   pip install -v -e .
   ```
